Howdy! Thanks for contributing! I don't really have a whole lot of requirements for contributing to this project as it's so small, but just a couple guidelines:

1. Please make sure to test your code before opening a PR! This project doesn't (yet) have any automated tests (unless you'd like to write some?) so testing PRs is a must. I'll test PRs as well before merging them in, but I'm only one person and may miss some stuff.
2. Please be kind in your commit messages, PRs, and any opened issues.
3. Any questions, feel free to open an issue or send me an email.
