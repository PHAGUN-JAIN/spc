# goify [Tentative Name]
A lightweight mutliplatform CLI for Spotify
## Goals
The goal of this project is to present a simple, lightweight command line interface for Spotify, inspired by [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui). Support for play, pause, volume, and a simple search are all that are considered right now. The roadmap may change in the future.
